# [Diagonal Difference][Diagonal Difference]
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix __arr__ is shown below:
> 1 2 3
 4 5 6
 7 8 9
The left-to-right diagonal 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. The right to left diagonal 3 + 5 + 9 = 17. Their absolute difference is |15 - 17| = 2.

## Function description
Complete the __diagonalDifference__ function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:
- arr: an array of integers .

## Input Format
The first line contains a single integer, __n__, the number of rows and columns in the matrix __arr__. 

## Output Format
Print the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.
